  <h3>Hello world! Today's second topic is the <u>inaccuracy of Apple Weather's Precipitation Reports</u>. </h3>
    I am a car enthusiast. Furthermore, I also enjoy detailing cars. Logically, I check the weather before taking action to wash a car. Last night, I checked Apple Weather for a precipitation report. "None expected in the next 10 days." This was around 7:00 pm. I go ahead, washing my mom's car, my dad's car, and my sister's car. After I finish, it is around 9:30pm. I go inside to eat dinner. I doomscroll through tiktok while eating. Suddenly, I get a notification. "Light rain expected in 10 minutes." I walk outside. All my work washed away. Literally.
