    <h3>Hello world! Today's third topic is the <u>importance of sleep</u>. </h3>
  Teenagers constantly trade hours of sleep for hours on social media or video games. They do not realize how crucial sleep is for their development mentally and physically. Not only that, showing up to school groggy and unwilling to learn will greatly impact knowledge retention and levels of attention. Combined, these responses to sleep deprivation will lead to long term, compounded impacts to knowledge and physical growth.
