    <h3>Hello world! Today's topic is the <u>parental influence on decision making</u>. </h3>
    Coming from a South-Asian household, parental pressure is everything. Even though they make comparable incomes, desi
    parents think of computer programmers as inferior compared to doctors. Adolescents growing up with such a mindset
    surrounding them can be easily swayed from what better fits their personal interests. Personally, I believe that
    life is too short to have someone else's opinions impact decisions you make that will affect your entire timeline.
